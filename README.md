# My Unix/Linux Workspace

Feel free to pilfer. Assumes a `repos/workspace` location for everything. If
you live dangerously you could do something like this (but make sure you
look at the files, even customize them to your own values, before):

```bash 
cd ~
mkdir repos
cd repos
git clone git@github.com:robmuh/workspace.git
cd workspace
./setup
```
