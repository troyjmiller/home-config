# SkilStak Home Config Helper

***You don't need this is you are only working from `code.skilstak.io`. If
you are setting up your own multi-user Linux environment take a look at
[`usr-share-skilstak`](http://github.com/skilstak/usr-share-skilstak)
instead.***

This repo is to help you create a SkilStak-ish workspace on your
own Linux/Mac computer or Raspberry Pi.

```bash 
cd ~
mkdir repos
cd repos
git clone git@github.com:skilstak/workspace.git
cd workspace
./setup
```

# Dependencies

Eventually `setup` may including looking up dependencies and prompting
for installing them (packages, commands, apps). For now you will
have to ensure you have the following installed, (which you learn
to do in class if you don't know):

* [git/GitHub](http://github.com)
* [vim 7.4+](http://www.vim.org)
* [Python 3+](http://www.python.org)
* [Java OpenJDK 7+](http://openjdk.java.net)
* [Node/NPM](http://nodejs.org)
* [Harp](http://harpjs.com)
* [Surge](http://surge.sh)
* [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome)
* [Solarized terminal](solarized)
