# Standard SkilStak Workspace 

***You don't need this is you are working from `code.skilstak.io` since it
is all setup for you automatically.***

This repo is to help you create a SkilStak-ish workspace on your
own Linux/Mac computer or Raspberry Pi.

```bash 
cd ~
mkdir repos
cd repos
git clone git@github.com:skilstak/workspace.git
cd workspace
./setup
```

# Dependencies

Eventually would like to have `setup` look for the packages, commands,
and apps used by this workspace. Until then make sure you have the
following installed, (which you learn to do in class if you don't
know):

* git
* vim 7.4+
* Python 3+
* Java JDK 7+ 
* Node/NPM
* Harp.js
* Surge.js
* Solarized terminal
